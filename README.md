# Background
You are tasked with creating a neural network that HR can use to predict whether employees are likely to leave the company. Additionally, HR believes that some employees may be better suited to other departments, so you are also asked to predict the department that best fits each employee. These two columns should be predicted using a branched neural network.


# Summary

In the provided space below, briefly answer the following questions.

### 1. Is accuracy the best metric to use on this data? Why or why not?
- Accuracy is a good metric for Binary Classification:
Accuracy can be a good metric if the classes are balanced and the cost of false positives and false negatives is similar.
In Multi-Class Classification:
Accuracy can be useful, but other metrics like the macro-averaged F1 score might provide more insight, especially in imbalanced datasets.
With Multi-Label Classification:
Accuracy can be less informative. Instead, metrics like the subset accuracy, Hamming loss, or average precision are often used.


### 2. What activation functions did you choose for your output layers, and why?
- Softmax Activation Function
The softmax activation function is typically used in the output layer of a classification model where you need to predict probabilities of each class, especially for multi-class classification problems. 
When you have a classification problem with more than two classes, softmax in the output layer provides a clear, interpretable, and probabilistic prediction.

### 3. Can you name a few ways that this model might be improved?
- Below are some methods of improving the model 
1. Hyperparameter Tuning
Learning Rate: Adjust the learning rate to find the optimal value that allows the model to converge faster and more effectively.
Batch Size: Experiment with different batch sizes to find the best balance between convergence speed and stability.
Number of Epochs: Train for more epochs if the model hasn't converged yet, but be cautious of overfitting.
2. Data Augmentation
Augment Training Data: Use techniques like rotation, flipping, scaling, and cropping to artificially increase the size of your training dataset.
3. Early Stopping and Model Checkpointing
Early Stopping: Stop training when the model's performance on a validation set stops improving.
python
3. Transfer Learning
Pretrained Models: Use a pretrained model and fine-tune it on your dataset.
4. Cross-Validation
K-Fold Cross-Validation: Evaluate the model using k-fold cross-validation to ensure its performance is consistent across different subsets of the data.
